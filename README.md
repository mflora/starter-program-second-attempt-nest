# StarterProgramSecondAttempt

It's just a small exercise program for myself to learn NodeJS and NestJS.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
The program contains a login and profile page's endpoints and server-sie logics.


## Tip
Use together with the [frontend](https://github.com/mflora/starter-program-second-attempt) program I wrote to it.


## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api` to use the swagger.
